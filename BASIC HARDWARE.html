2.1.2 Measuring the Voltage
Voltage  can  be  considered  as  the  pressure  that  forc
e  the  electrons  to  flow.  The 
voltage  is  being  measured  by  measuring  the  differen
ce  between  the  voltages  at  the 
two  terminals  of  the  device-under-test  which  is  the
  (voltage  drop).  This  can  be 
performed using a measuring instrument called voltm
eter.
Figure (1) illustrates how to connect voltmeter in 
the circuit to measure the 
voltage across the resistor.

3.1 Ohm's law 
Ohm
‘
s  law  is  the  most  important  mathematical  relationsh
ip  between  voltage, 
current and resistance in electricity. 
It is important to know how to read the resistors' 
colour code and hence its ohmic value. In 
the  following  figure  it  shows  a  table  of  the  meanin
g  of  each  colour.  For  example,  for  the 
resistor  in  the  figure(1),the  value  of  the  resistor
  is  200k
,since  the  band  1  is  red  i.e. 
equivalent to 2 in the table ,band 2 is black equiv
alent to zero in the table and the band 3 is 
yellow indicating  of a multiplier of 10,000.see at
 the bottom of the figure. 
V = I
 X
 R
14
The fourth band is the tolerance band i.e the perce
ntage of error.  It usually comes in two 
colors  ,the  silver  indicates  ±5%  and  the  gold  indic
ates  ±10%.so  for  example,  the  value 
resistor will lie between 210k
 and 190k
.
Procedure
1.
Select a number of different resistors 
2.
Use the table below to determine their values 
3.
Use ohmmeter to measure the same resistors you figu
red out 
4.
Compare your calculated values with the readings yo

To measure resistance, connect the ohmmeter across 
the resistor. The resistor 
must first removed from the circuit. This procedure
 is shown in figure(2).

The ROM-BIOS (Read Only Memory - Basic Input Output

chip held on your computer's system (mother) board.
 It contains software that is 
required to make your computer work with your opera
ting system, for instance it is 
responsible for copying your operating system into 
RAM when you switch on your 
computer.
What is inside the IC?
Miniaturized  electronic  circuit  produced  on  a  singl

 IC is encapsulated within a plastic or

I  have  received  a  number  of  requests,  asking  just  w
hat  goes  on  inside  logic 
gates  to  actually  perform  logic  functions.  So,  by  p
opular  demand,  here  are  the 
internal  schematics  of  various  gates,  as  implemente
d  by  several  different  logic 
families.
I  won't  cover  the  internal  operation  of  individual 
semiconductor  devices  in 
these  pages,  except  to  state  the  basic  behavior  of 
a  given  device  under  specific 
conditions.   More   detailed   coverage   of   semiconductor
   physics   and   internal 
behavior is a job for another set of pages, which w
ill come later.
There  are  several  different  families  of  logic  gates
.  Each  family  has  its 
capabilities and limitations, its advantages and di
sadvantages. The following list 
describes  the  main  logic  families  and  their  charact
eristics.  You  can  follow  the 
links to see the circuit construction of gates of e
ach family.
Diode Logic (DL)
Diode  logic  gates  use  diodes  to  perform  AND  and  OR 
logic  functions. 
Diodes  have  the  property  of  easily  passing  an  elect
rical  current  in  one 
direction, but not the other. Thus, diodes can act 
as a logical switch.
Diode  logic  gates  are  very  simple  and  inexpensive, 
and  can  be  used 
effectively in specific situations. However, they c
annot be used extensively, as 
they tend to degrade digital signals rapidly. In ad
dition, they cannot perform a 
NOT function, so their usefulness is quite limited.
