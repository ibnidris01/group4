The motherboard is installed into the case on an 
angle, with the back edge and the I/O core going 
first. Once the I/O core is properly aligned with t
he 
shield, you can push the ports through the openings
and set the motherboard down on the standoffs. 
Check for wires and cables having been caught 
below the motherboard before you start securing it 
with screws.  
We counted out seven screws to match the number of 
standoffs in the case, and now we are going to use 
every one of those screws to secure the motherboard
. 
If there's a screw leftover when you're done, it me
ans 
that there's a metal standoff that didn't end up un
der a 
hole in the motherboard, and is probably waiting fo
r 
you to plug in the power and burn up the replacemen
t 
motherboard. In other words, if you didn't use up a
ll 
the screws, take the motherboard back out and count
again. If you counted right, you need to visually 
inspect the motherboard and the standoff locations,
figure out which one isn't being used, and remove i
t. 
pg. 44 
I like to make the most important motherboard 
connection first, and that's the power switch. It's
normally labeled "PW SW" or "Power SW" and the 
motherboard will be labeled with "PW SW", "P-
ON" "PW" or something similarly cryptic. You 
won't hurt anything if you attach the power switch 
to 
the wrong connector in the block, but you won't get
the PC to turn on either. I went ahead and connecte
d 
the rest of the front panel leads to the motherboar
d, 
but you really don't need to. Nobody uses reset 
switches or keyboard locks anymore, most 
motherboards have a built in piezoelectric speaker,
and who cares about LED's.  
Now it's time to load the adapters back in, in no 
particular order. I did the PCI adapters first, sta
rting 
with the modem, and I even reinstalled the sound 
card even though the replacement motherboard had 
integrated sound. Last was the AGP adapter, which 
fortunately was compatible with the new 
motherboard. If you were doing a serious 
motherboard upgrade, with PCI Express or AGP 8X 
video, you'd need a new video card as well.  
pg. 45 
As soon as all the adapter are in place, secure the
m 
all with a single hold down screw on the back rail.
 It 
pays to do them all at once since the exact 
dimensions of each card and motherboard vary a 
little, which means if you installed the adapters a
nd 
secured them one at a time, you might have to 
loosen the screws up later to get another adapter t
o 
seat in the motherboard. Just make sure you inspect
the way the adapters are seated in the motherboard 
when you're done, that inserting the screw didn't 
force the back of the adapter down so far that the 
front popped out, especially with AGP cards.  
Standard ATX motherboards all use the 20 pin ATX 
power connector, but newer motherboards for 
Pentium 4 and Athlon 64 will always require at leas
t 
one more connection, often a 2x2 12V header, 
sometimes an addition 1x4 lead, as the type used fo
r 
the drives  
All that's left is reconnecting all the drive cable
s, 
power and data, that we undid when removing the 
old motherboard (left). The recent ATA ports are 
color coded for use with 80 wire cables and auto 
selecting master/slave on ATA drives. If you have 
serial ATA (SATA) drives, it's even easier, just on
e 
slim data cable per drive. Plenty more details for 
the 
individual component is available in the other 
replacing parts pages on this site if you get a lit
tle 
lost. Below we finish the job off with a cable tie,
just to neaten up the case a little and encourage 
better air circulation.

WEEK  8 
Replacing the CPU:    
One of the most items that is continuously upgraded
 is the processor (CPU). 
When choosing to upgrade a CPU you must know the pe
rformance of it compared to 
the older one. For instance, you should not replace
 an Intel  2.4 GHz CPU with 512 KB 
cache memory with an Intel 2.8 GHz with 256 cache. 
The following steps depict the process of replacing
 the CPU, they show replacing an 
AMD Athlon processor. 
Despite the high clock speeds and 
high he
at dissipation of modern CPU, 
out-and-out CPU failure is a fairly 
rare occurrence. Replacing a CPU 
isn't particularly challenging if you've 
done it before, but it can be a little 
intimidating for the first timer..  
pg. 47 
The first step to replace a CPU is to remove the 
heatsink. All modern CPU's require an active 
heatsink, a chunk of finned heat-conductive metal 
with a cooling and mounted on top. The leading 
cause of CPU failure is probably fan failure, since
the CPU can overheat and sustain damage if 
there's not enough cooling air flowing over the 
fins. The only rule of thumb for removing 
heatsinks is to study the latching mechanism then 
use your thumb to release it.  
A standard Socket A heatsink is 
latched on both sides, but as soon as 
you release the main spring force by 
doing the easy side, the other side 
will fall off as you lift the heatsink 
away from the CPU. You can see the 
dried out (not so good) thermal 
compound on our old Athlon as we 
lift away the heatsink. You can just 
see the same dried out crud on the 
bottom of the heatsink at this angle.  
All modern CPUs since the inception of Socket 7 
back in the early 90's have used ZIF (Zero 
Insertion Force) sockets, where the CPU legs are 
locked in place by moving a locking lever. To 
remove the Athlon CPU, we first have to release 
the locking lever and lift it up to the vertical 
position. The Athlon CPU is then lifted straight 
out of the socket (below). Also below, to the right
, 
we show the keying on two corners of the socket 
and the CPU that prevents you from installing it 
improperly.  
pg. 48 
The new Athlon CPU we are installing here isn't a 
new CPU at all, it's a "pull", a CPU that's been 
removed from a system. When you shop for a 
replacement CPU to install on an older 
motherboard, you'll see that the prices are super 
low and most are identified as "pulls. The Athlon 
is installed in the socket and locked into place 
with the locking lever, which is pulled a little 
away from the side of the socket to get past the 
locking nub.  
pg. 49 
Now comes the critical step. All 
modern CPUs require some sort of 
thermal material be added to the die 
to improve the thermal interface with 
the heatsink. The purpose of a 
thermal compound, like this Arctic 
Silver Ceramique, is to fill in the 
microscopic voids in both the CPU 
die and the metal bottom of the 
heatsink. You down't want to drown 
the CPU in thermal compound, just 
use enough (many manufacturers 
define the amount as a large grain of 
rice or a small pea) so when the 
heatsink presses down on it, it will 
spread over the die.  
That's it, time to reinstall the heatsink by first 
latching the far side of the retaining spring over 
the center nub on the opposite side of the socket. 
You can see it latched on here between the 
capacitors, which makes this the "poor access" 
side and the reason we install the CPU heatsink 
retainer on this side first.  
Next we do the hard side, which 
we've mad a lot easier by pulling the 
power supply first:-) With the active 
heatsink in place, the final step is 
reconnecting the power to the 
heatsink fan (below) to the CPU fan 
point on the motherboard. It's critical 
you connect it to the proper point 
which the BIOS manages for low 
power and sleep modes.
